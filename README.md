# Modelling primer

Some data and materials that can be used for getting started with computational modelling using both maximum-likelihood estimation and hierarchical Bayesian estimation.

- Part 1 (in progress): *Q*-learning with maximum likelihood estimation
- Part 2 (to come): the MOAT model with maximum likelihood estimation
- Part 3 (to come): *Q*-learning with hierarchical Bayesian estimation
- Part 4 (to come): the MOAT model with hierarhical Bayesian estimation
